# 🚗🔋 Electric Vehicle Sales Trends in India  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales trends across Indian states**, providing insights for **market planning, infrastructure investment, and policy development**. It also includes a **predictive model** to estimate future EV sales.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Identify Trends**: Analyze EV sales trends across different states.  
- **Analyze Vehicle Categories**: Explore the most popular vehicle types and their growth.  
- **Predict Future Sales**: Use machine learning to forecast EV demand.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Data Analysis:** SQL, Excel  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest Regressor  

## 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes **EV sales records** across Indian states with key attributes:  
- **State**: Name of the state where sales occurred.  
- **Year & Month**: Date of sales.  
- **Vehicle Type**: 2-Wheelers, 4-Wheelers, etc.  
- **Vehicle Category**: Passenger, Commercial, etc.  
- **EV Sales Quantity**: Number of EVs sold per state.  

## 🔧 Data Processing  
- **Missing Values:** Filled numerical data with median, categorical data with mode.  
- **Date Conversion:** Converted date columns to proper **DateTime** format.  
- **Encoding:** Encoded categorical variables for analysis.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.  

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **EV Sales Growth:** Significant increase in sales, with **major growth post-2018** due to government incentives and rising demand.  
- **State-wise Trends:** Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh **lead in EV adoption** due to better infrastructure and policies.  
- **Vehicle Category Trends:**  
  - **2-Wheelers** dominate the market.  
  - **Commercial 3-Wheelers** are also growing in popularity.  
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Used a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict EV sales.  
  - Achieved **high accuracy** in forecasting demand.  
  - **State and Vehicle Type** were the most significant factors in predictions.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- **Enhance Model**: Implement Deep Learning for better accuracy.  
- **Expand Dataset**: Include more recent years (2024 & beyond).  
- **Incorporate Macroeconomic Factors**: Fuel prices, government policies, etc.  
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Use live data for ongoing EV sales tracking.
